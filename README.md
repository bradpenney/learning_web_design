# Learning Web Design 🌟💻

Hey there! 👋 I'm Brad, a backend software engineer diving into the world of front-end web design. This repo is my little sandbox 🏖️ for learning and experimenting with basic front-end projects.

## What's This About? 🤔

The goal here is simple: to add some front-end skills to my back-end toolkit 🛠️. These projects are super basic and meant for personal learning, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. But hey, if you're here, feel free to look around! 🚀

Thanks for stopping by! 😊 Happy coding! 💻✨
